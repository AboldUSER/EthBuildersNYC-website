# EthBuilders.nyc Website
A simple website for EthBuilders.NYC detailing basic info like events and links for people to peruse.

## Goal:
Let's aim to start simple and add to it over time. The first initial purpose is to provide a better experience than meetup.com. 

The website will have a list of events and useful links for members.

We can shoot to have something like [BitDevs.org](https://bitdevs.org/)

Later on, we can get more ambitious. But let's keep it simple for now.

## Tech:
Let's aim to use:
- React
- ES6
- [BaseWeb](https://baseweb.design/) - Uber's design system

## Design System
We are using a design system because:
1. Its easy to just add components without having to think about css and designing
2. We can template the existing code to change styles if needed.
