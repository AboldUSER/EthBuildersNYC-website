# website
A simple website for EthBuilders.NYC detailing basic info like events and links for people to peruse.

## Goal:
Let's aim to start simple and add to it over time. The first initial purpose is to provide a better experience than meetup.com. 

The website will have a list of events and useful links for members.

We can shoot to have something like [BitDevs.org](https://bitdevs.org/)

Later on, we can get more ambitious. But let's keep it simple for now.
